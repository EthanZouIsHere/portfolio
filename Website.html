     <p> There are over 390,000 different species of plants all over the world. Plants give humans the oxygen they need by using a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants use their leaves to trap light energy and they use the sun's energy to change water and carbon dioxide into glucose.

     <p> There are two main types of plants: Vascular and Non-Vascular Plants. Vascular plants have lignified tissues to conduct water. Some examples are flowers, grasses, and vines. Vascular plants have a shoot system, a root system, and a vascular system.

     <p> Non-Vascular plants include mosses, hornworts and liverworts, and some algae. Non-Vascular plants reproduce spores instead of seeds. Some non-vascular plants have developed specialized tissue for water transport. Non-Vascular plants do not have a xylem, phloem, and a vascular system. Also, instead of having roots, Non-Vascular plants have something called a rhizoid. Rhizoids are small hairs that keep the plants in place.
